# Why Write?
###### 08/09/2023



At first, I thought the most important reason for me to write was to gain the skill of writing thoughts clearly and concisely, which obviously has many real-world applications and is important in business. 
However, I was watching My Dinner with Andre they quite clearly state a much better reason for taking the time to write, especially thoughts and feelings: often when you say what you think or feel to people they freak out. It is an odd thing to do, there are rather strict guidelines by which you must interact with others, and nowhere in those guidelines is it permitted to be obstructively truthful. I find things people say and do fascinatingly odd and interesting. I cannot ever say this however or it is interpreted as saying they are weird and do not fit in with society, which obviously has negative implications. They get defensive and distance themselves, likely feeling vulnerable and foolish for sharing anything with me or anyone else. 

Writing provides freedom from this. I can express my real true thoughts about people, including myself, and the world we have built around us without alienating myself or anyone else in the process. And, perhaps more importantly, I maintain my free will. I do not become, as Andre describes, one of these people living in a dream world and robbing others of their free will by drawing them into my dream world and out of reality, 
where you can actually see things and interpret them with some originality and integrity.

It is a shame though. I feel as though most people have something they see in the world that no one else has quite yet seen or expressed. It is for this reason that they will never share their thoughts - the very same reason they ought to be sharing.

I think continuously learning new things shares a similar value. It constantly shifts your perception and keeps you in reality, having to interpret new things around you. When you live a life of constant habit you stop perceiving and live in this fantasy land of repetition and focusing on a very small number of things.
